# Todo App in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
This project is my first project using html, css and javaScript to get a hands on practice on javaScript DOM topic. It clearly illustrates the main use of DOM that how can you use javaScript to change the frontend dynamically.

## Technologies used
* HTML
*CSS & Bootstrap
* JavaScript


# First Look
It is designed beautifully to interact the user. I have used bootstrap to make it's look attractive!

Whenever a user tries to add the task without even writing someething it will show error that the input can't be empty.
